\section*{Lessons from Japan's Centenarians: Traditions and Proverbs for Happiness and Longevity}
\textbf{\textit{Core Principles for Longevity}}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\textit{Don't Worry}}: Maintaining a relaxed and stress-free attitude is fundamental. The centenarians of Ogimi emphasize the importance of not letting worries dominate one's life, fostering a sense of inner peace and contentment.
    \item \textbf{\textit{Cultivate Good Habits}}: Engaging in regular physical activity, eating a balanced diet, and maintaining consistent daily routines are common practices. Many centenarians also wake up early, sleep early, grow their own vegetables, and engage in spiritual practices. These habits contribute to both physical health and mental clarity.
    \item \textbf{\textit{Nurture Friendships Daily}}: Frequent, joyful interactions with loved ones — chatting, singing, dancing, sharing tea, or even simple greetings — nurture emotional well-being and a sense of belonging. Many belong to a moai (a lifelong social group), rooted in yuimaaru, the spirit of mutual support—from farming to building homes together.
    \item \textbf{\textit{Live an Unhurried Life}}: Embrace a slower pace—do one thing at a time with full presence. This reduces stress, deepens mindfulness, and enhances joy. Even in the smallest tasks, they show passion and intention.
\end{itemize}
